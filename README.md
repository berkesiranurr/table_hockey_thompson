# Thompson Sampling Hockey Game

A simple and fun 2D hockey simulation game implemented in Python using pygame. This game showcases the practical application of the Thompson Sampling algorithm to make strategic decisions for player movement.

Features
Dynamic 2D graphics with smooth animations.
Two AI-controlled players using Thompson Sampling for strategic defense.
Real-time scoring system displayed on the screen.
Configurable gameplay parameters for speed, strategies, and difficulty.
How It Works
The game uses the Thompson Sampling algorithm to dynamically select one of three strategies for player defense:

Follow the ball: Moves directly towards the ball's position.
Predictive defense: Adjusts position based on a randomized prediction of the ball's path.
Random movement: Adds unpredictable movement for defensive diversity.
